In pursuing my studies in Website Development at BYU Idaho, my primary objective is to earn my bachelor's degree and secure a position in the field. I am driven by a strong determination to succeed, believing it to be the key factor in achieving my goals. I envision collaborating closely with peers, working diligently to maximize our collective potential and pave the way towards realizing these ambitions.
